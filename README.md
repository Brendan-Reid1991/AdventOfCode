# AdventOfCode
The Advent of Code challenge for 2023.

I've added a `python` folder with the aim of adding a `rust` folder in the future, as this would be a good opportunity to learn rust. 

The code written here is as concise as could be, with zero bells and whistles. I am often tempted to write QOL functions, or nice-to-haves, or helper functions, but these are not necessary here.
